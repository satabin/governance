# Pair Programming with Tuple

[Tuple](https://tuple.app/) is a pair programming tool with clients available for MacOS and Linux (beta). 
Tuple provides low latency screen-sharing, crisp audio and visual (video is optional), easy-to-handoff mouse and keyboard control, as well as a very helpful screen drawing feature for whiteboarding.

- You can [download Tuple here](https://tuple.app/downloads/)
- You can [read more about pairing here](https://tuple.app/pair-programming-guide)

We expect any usage of Tuple to abide by our [code of conduct](https://typelevel.org/code-of-conduct). Please follow the contact procedures outlined in the code of conduct for any questions or to report a violation. 

## For Typelevel Maintainers

#### Getting Setup

Members of the Typelevel GitHub organization have access to a Tuple license as part of the Typelevel Tuple team. 
You can request to be added to the team via any of the following:
- [opening a GitHub issue in this repo](https://github.com/typelevel/governance/issues/new?labels=tuple&body=cc+@samspills)
  - please provide the email address you intend to use with Tuple
  - The link should autopopulate but in case it doesn't: please use the `tuple` label, and tag `@samspills` in the body of the issue
- asking an existing member of the Typelevel Tuple team to [invite you to the team](https://docs.tuple.app/article/41-inviting-users)
- posting a message in the `#admin` channel in the Typelevel Discord
  - feel free to tag `@spills` in your message
  - please include the email you intend to use with Tuple

Only one person in a pairing session needs access to a license. This means that Typelevel members can pair with new contributors without inviting them to the Typelevel team. 
Tuple does not integrate with GitHub and we only have a limited number of seats available, so please try to ensure only maintainers are added to the team.

#### Pairing with New Contributors

You can pair with new contributors by following these steps:
1. point them to the [New Contributors section](#for-new-contributors-and-guests) so they can get setup
2. add them as a `friend outside my team`, following [the alternate invite instructions](https://docs.tuple.app/article/41-inviting-users)
3. you can now start a pairing session with them the same way you would with someone within the team

## For New Contributors and Guests

New contributors and guests are able to pair with any member of the Typelevel organization without a Tuple license of their own. 
To get setup, follow these steps:

1. [download Tuple here](https://tuple.app/downloads/)
2. Share the email address used to setup Tuple with the person you'd like to pair with
3. They can then initiate a pairing session with you.
