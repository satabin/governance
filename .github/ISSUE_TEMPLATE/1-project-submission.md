### Project Name
<!-- This will be used as the project name under the Typelevel GitHub org -->

### Project Short Description
<!-- This will be used as the GitHub repo description -->

### Project Type
In accordance with the [Typelevel Charter](https://github.com/typelevel/governance/blob/main/CHARTER.md#8-project-criteria), I am proposing the project be a:

- [ ] Organization Project
- [ ] Affiliate Project

### Project Management

All Typelevel projects follow the Typelevel Code of Conduct.
Organization projects do not need a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file, as the Typelevel GitHub Organization one will automatically apply.

<p>

Affiliate projects should copy the following template into a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file in their repo:

```
